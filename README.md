In this project, we aim to detect what appliances are switched on at what point of time in a household. Using the householdâ€™s main power supply, analyzing various quantities (voltage, current, power factor, active and reactive powers), we determine which appliance is powered on, with the help of data analytics.
We firstly implemented a Smart Meter circuit consisting of a circuit controlled by a microcontroller. Then we collected the data set comprising V rms , I rms , Power Factor, Active & Reactive powers and Apparent power. Various classification algorithms were trained using this data, and the best algorithm were chosen out of them.
